# ECG_denoising_autoencoders
We are using autoencoders to denoise nosiy ECG signals, the ECG data is fetched from MIT-BIH lib and noise is collected from MIT Noise stress test.

there are 3 prominent noises in ECG and we are using 3 different autoencoders to denoise it.

the above models are built to be run on google colab
